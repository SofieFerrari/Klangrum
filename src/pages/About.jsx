            {`As an Interior Designer/Architect with 4 years of work experience, I
          have mainly worked with store interiors and offices at the interior
          design side. I have established a good ability to create selling rooms
          and efficient flows - both for interior and exterior. \n\n In the role of
          an Architect, I also have experience in drawing alterations and
          additions with ROT orientation for private clients as well as building
          permit documents for private clients and stores. \n\n And as a piano
          player/teacher I've worked teaching kids and teenagers how to play
          piano from the age of 6-25 years old. I've also worked as a barpiano
          player at the Silja Line Galaxy. At last I've also played in several
          pop/jazz/folk bands and been singing in different choirs.`}
